I built this website for free using open source technologies and github pages

# Hosting - Github Pages

Github provides a feature that allows you to build a website from your Github repository by simply creating a repository named username.github.io.

For more information, please visit: https://pages.github.com/

# Site Design Templating - Hugo + Templates

I have utilized the Hugo open-source static site generator, which is a Go open-source project (see: https://gohugo.io/), and its theme support feature (used: https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) to create this elegant template.
